## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

As of July 2022, this is the most involved React app I've worked on so far. This project really tested my knowledge on the relationship between components. I also learned how to interact with Local Storage, and how to deploy my project on a hosting site like Vercel.

### Continued development

The code is a bit messy. I would consider seperating the functions from Comment.js into a seperate file. It would also be interesting if users could sort comments by popularity.
